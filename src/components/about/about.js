              Everything that goes around me is what makes me think
              andÂ visualize it. I started seeking things that exist on the web
              the day I connected to the computer. I've never given up on
              learning and trying to implement whether it's a web design, CSS,
              JS, or building an application. Coding and Designing have always
              fascinated me.

              Fast forward to 2023, I developed small and big applications,
              starting from learning and connecting front-end and back-end
              technologies with Node.js and Express.js to UI/UX design,
              HTML/CSS/React.js, and working with databases. Whatever I've done, is
              a vital stepping-stone for what I am today.

              The thing that excites me the most as Front End Web Developer is
              being able to understand, learn new technologies, and create ideas
              based on user requirements, add CRUD operations, and provide
              authentication services.{" "}
